              <div class="half-width">
                <p> I've made my home right in the heart of New York City in the Upper East Side. My career started with a degree from Penn State University...GO LIONS!!!  I got my start as a small business owner in the retail wine and spirts industry. Then after learning how to create websites, I would like to venture into a whole new industry....TECH!!!</p>
              </div>
              <div class="half-width">
                <p> That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I've made a switch to web development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.  All while still running the wine shops!</p>
